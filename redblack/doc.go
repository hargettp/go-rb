/*
An implementation of Left-Leaning Red-Black Trees, based on "Left-Leaning Red-Black Trees," 
Robert Sedgwick, Dagstuhl Workshop on Data Structures 2008 (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/talks/LLRB/LLRB.pdf).

In addition to providing a traditional in-memory implementation, the package also provides
a framework for persistent implementations useful for building append-only disk structures,
similar to CouchDB's (http://couchdb.apache.org) file format.
